sentence=Library for controlling LED matrix displays via serial communication with preamble synchronization
paragraph=LEDMatrix provides an easy-to-use interface for ESP32 to control LED matrix displays connected to Raspberry Pi. Supports text display with custom BDF fonts, animated GIF playback, text blinking effects, and screen management commands. Communicates over serial using a robust protocol with Ethernet-like preamble (0xAA 0x55 0xAA 0x55) for reliable synchronization in noisy environments, operating at up to 1 Mbps.
